# Responsive-E-Commerce-Website-with-Shopping-Cart-Functionality
This project is a frontend-based e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to cart, update quantity, and see total price dynamically. The cart updates in real-time using JavaScript DOM manipulation, and I used localStorage to maintain cart data even after page refresh.
